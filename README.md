Mini Web Dev Project â€“ Guess the Number Game
<p> 
Just built a small practice project using HTML, CSS & JavaScript:

âœ¨ Features:

Computer generates a random number between 1â€“100.

User enters a guess through an input box.

Logic checks the guess â†’ tells if itâ€™s correct or wrong.

Shows result dynamically on the page (instead of using alerts).

This exercise is super helpful for:

Practicing DOM manipulation

Strengthening logic building with if/else

Understanding Math.random() in JavaScript

A simple but powerful way to sharpen coding skills ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥ </p>
